For the next question, it will ask you what school you go to or graduated from. If you start typing your school name it will give you suggestions that you can select. If for some reason the auto select doesnâ€™t pop up, click in the white space and try again. After you click next, you will be asked for your full name, gender, nationality, and your birthday.
